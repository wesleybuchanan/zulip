# Email

This page has developer documentation on the Zulip email system. If you're
trying to configure your server to send email, you might be looking for our
guide to [sending outgoing email](../production/email.html). If you're trying to
configure an email integration to receive incoming email (e.g. so that users
can reply to missed message emails via email), you might be interested in
our instructions for
[setting up an email integration](https://zulipchat.com/integrations/doc/email).

On to the documentation. Zulip's email system is fairly straightforward,
with only a few things you need to know to get started.

* All email templates are in `templates/zerver/emails/`. Each email has three
  template files: `<template_prefix>.subject`, `<template_prefix>.txt`, and
  `<template_prefix>.html`. Email templates, along with all other templates
  in the `templates/` directory, are Jinja2 templates.
* Most of the CSS and HTML layout for emails is in `email_base.html`. Note
  that email has to ship with all of its CSS and HTML, so nothing in
  `static/` is useful for an email. If you're adding new CSS or HTML for an
  email, there's a decent chance it should go in `email_base.html`.
* All email is eventually sent by `zerver.lib.send_email.send_email`. There
  are several other functions in `zerver.lib.send_email`, but all of them
  eventually call the `send_email` function. The most interesting one is
  `send_future_email`. The `ScheduledEmail` entries are eventually processed
  by a supervisor job that runs `zerver/management/commands/deliver_email.py`.
* A good way to find a bunch of example email pathways is to `git grep` for
  `zerver/emails` in the `zerver/` directory.

One slightly complicated decision you may have to make when adding an email
is figuring out how to schedule it. There are 3 ways to schedule email.
* Send it immediately, in the current Django process, e.g. by calling
  `send_email` directly. An example of this is the `confirm_registration`
  email.
* Add it to a queue. An example is the `invitation` email.
* Send it (approximately) at a specified time in the future, using
  `send_future_email`. An example is the `followup_day2` email.

Email takes about a quarter second per email to process and send. Generally
speaking, if you're sending just one email, doing it in the current process
is fine. If you're sending emails in a loop, you probably want to send it
from a queue. Documentation on our queueing system is available
[here](../subsystems/queuing.html).

## Development and testing

All the emails sent in the development environment can be accessed by
visiting `/emails` in the browser.  The way that this works is that
we've set the email backend (aka what happens when you call the email
`.send()` method in Django) in the development environment to be our
our custom backend, `EmailLogBackEnd`.  It does the following:

* Logs any sent emails to `var/log/email_content.log`. This log is
  displayed by the `/emails` endpoint
  (e.g. http://zulip.zulipdev.com:9991/emails).
* Print a friendly message on console advertising `/emails` to make
  this nice and discoverable.

You can also forward all the emails sent in the development environment
to an email id of your choice by clicking on **Forward emails to a mail
account** in `/emails` page. This feature can be used for testing how
emails gets rendered by different email clients. Before enabling this
you have to first configure the following SMTP settings.

* The hostname `EMAIL_HOST` in `zproject/dev_settings.py`
* The username `EMAIL_HOST_USER` in `zproject/dev_settings.py`.
* The password `email_password` in `zproject/dev-secrets.conf`.

See [this](../production/email.html#free-outgoing-email-services)
section for instructions on obtaining SMTP details.

**Note: The base_image_uri of the images in forwarded emails would be replaced
with `https://chat.zulip.org/static/images/emails` inorder for the email clients
to render the images. See `zproject/email_backends.py` for more details.**

While running the backend test suite, we use
`django.core.mail.backends.locmem.EmailBackend` as the email
backend. The `locmem` backend stores messages in a special attribute
of the django.core.mail module, "outbox". The outbox attribute is
created when the first message is sent. Itâ€™s a list with an
EmailMessage instance for each message that would be sent.
