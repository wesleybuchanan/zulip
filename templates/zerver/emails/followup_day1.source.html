<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Welcome to Zulip!</p>
<p>
    Zulip is the team communication solution that combines the real-time
    ease of chat with the threaded organization of email. At its core, Zulip
    is about productivity&mdash;making communication fun and easy, while
    avoiding the distracting and disorganized conversations of chatrooms.
</p>

<p>
    We hope you love using Zulip as much as we do. Zulip works best when
    it's always open, so we suggest pinning a browser tab or downloading
    our <a href="https://zulipchat.com/apps">desktop and mobile apps</a>.
    If you're new to Zulip's threading, we recommend starting with the
    desktop or browser experience, and using mobile for notifications on the
    go.
    {% if is_realm_admin %}
    If this is your first Zulip organization, we also recommend giving
    our <a href="{{ organization_setup_advice_link }}">guide for new
    admins</a> a spin.
    {% endif %}
</p>

<p>
    If you have any feedback, or want to see how we use Zulip for managing
    the Zulip project itself, swing by
    <a href="chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a> and say hi!
</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>Team Zulip</p>
