Hi there,

Welcome to Zulip!

Zulip is the team communication solution that combines the real-time ease of
chat with the threaded organization of email. At its core, Zulip is about
productivity -- making communication fun and easy, while avoiding the
distracting and disorganized conversations of chatrooms.

We hope you love using Zulip as much as we do. Zulip works best when it's
always open, so we suggest pinning a browser tab or downloading our desktop
and mobile apps (https://zulipchat.com/apps). If you're new to Zulip's
threading, we recommend starting with the desktop or browser experience, and
using mobile for notifications on the go.

If you have any feedback, or want to see how we use Zulip for managing the
Zulip project itself, swing by https://chat.zulip.org and say hi! {% if is_realm_admin %}If this is
your first Zulip organization, we also recommend checking out
{{ organization_setup_advice_link }}.{% endif %}

Cheers,
Team Zulip
