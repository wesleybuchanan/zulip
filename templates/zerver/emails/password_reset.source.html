    Someone (possibly you) requested a password reset email for {{ email }} on {{ attempted_realm.uri }}, but {{ email }} does not have an active account in {{ attempted_realm.uri }}.  However, {{ email }} does have an active account in {{ user.realm.uri }} organization; you can try logging in or resetting your password there.
    {% else %}
    Psst. Word on the street is that you need a new password, {{ email }}.<br />
    It's all good. Follow the link below and we'll take care of the rest:<br />
    {{ protocol }}://{{ user.realm.host }}{{ url('django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm', kwargs=dict(uidb64=uid, token=token)) }}
