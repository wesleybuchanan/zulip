{% if no_account_in_realm %}
Someone (possibly you) requested a password reset email for
{{ email }} on {{ realm_uri }}, but
you do not have an active account in {{ realm_uri }}.
{% if accounts %}
{% if multiple_accounts %}
However, you do have active accounts in the following organizations.
{% for account in accounts %}
{{ account.realm.uri }}
{% endfor %}
You can try logging in or resetting your password in the organization
you want.
{% else %}
However, you do have an active account in the {{ accounts[0].realm.uri }}
organization; you can try logging in or resetting your password there.
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% else %}
Psst. Word on the street is that you need a new password, {{ email }}.

It's all good. Follow the link below and we'll take care of the rest:

{{ reset_url }}

{% endif %}
Thanks,
