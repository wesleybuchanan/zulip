# Add a link preview

{!server-admin-only.md!}

Link previews are a way to see an overview of a link's content before
clicking on it. Previews can provide a useful summary of the content of a site
before you click on it, while also providing a quick integrity check to ensure
the link you meant to post is in fact correct.

Follow these steps to enable link previews:

1. Open the `zproject/settings.py` file in the Zulip directory.

   value from `False` to `True` to enable the embed preview feature.

Zulip currently supports up to five link previews per post â€” only the first
five link previews in the message will be shown.
