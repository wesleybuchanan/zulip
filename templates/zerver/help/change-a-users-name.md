# Change a user's name

{!admin-only.md!}

Ordinary users can [change their own names](/help/change-your-name), but
administrators can change users' names when users are
unavailable. Follow the following steps to change the name of a user.

1. Go to the [Users](/#organization/user-list-admin)
{!admin.md!}

2. Click on the pencil (<i class="icon-vector-pencil"></i>) icon next to
the name of the user you want to change.

3. After clicking on the pencil icon, an input field labeled **Full name** will
appear to allow you to change the user's name. Enter the user's new name in
**Full name**.
