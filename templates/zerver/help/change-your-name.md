# Change your name

By default, everyone can change their name in Zulip. You can write your name
in any language you'd like.

Organization administrators can
[change anyone's name](/help/change-a-users-name), and
[prevent users from changing their names](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes). This
is useful when users' names are managed via LDAP or another data source.

1. From your desktop, click on the **gear**
   (<i class="icon-vector-cog"></i>) in the upper right corner.

1. Select **Settings** from the dropdown.

1. Click the button with your name in it, under **User settings**.

    !!! warn ""
        **Note:** If clicking on the button doesn't work, check that your
        organization allows name changes. Follow the steps at
        [prevent users from changing their names](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes)
        and see if the relevant box is checked.

1. Change your name, and click **Save**.
