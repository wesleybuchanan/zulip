# Disable message history history

{!admin-only.md!}

Editing of messages is great for correcting typos, clarifying
language, etc.  However, sometimes a message is edited significantly
after others users replied to it, in a way that makes those original
replies no longer make sense.  For this reason, Zulip displays
messages that have been edited with an EDITED tag, and users can
[view the edit history of a message](/help/view-a-messages-edit-history)
to easily understand what happened.

If in your organization, you'd prefer that users not have access to
message edit history, you can disable message edit history for your
organization using the following steps:

1. Go to the [Organization settings](/#organization/settings)
{!admin.md!}

2. Disable the the **Enable message edit history** checkbox under the
**Message editing** section.

{!save-changes.md!} organization settings.
