# Enable or disable Press Enter to send

Zulip supports configuring whether the **Enter** key on your keyboard
sends a message that you are composing.

By default, the `Enter` (or `Return`) key simply adds a blank line to
the message when the **Press Enter to send** checkbox is
disabled. This is great if you want to write multi-line messages that
include blank lines, which is much more common in Zulip than in other
chat products.  In this default configuration, you can send a message
from the keyboard with `Ctrl+Enter`.

However, if you check the **Press Enter to send** checkbox in the
compose box, Zulip sends your message when you press `Enter` (or
`Return`) on your keyboard, and `Ctrl+Enter` will produce a newline.

Whether or not the **Press Enter to send** option is enabled, pressing
`Shift` + `Enter` inserts a new line in your message.
