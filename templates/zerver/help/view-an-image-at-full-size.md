# View an image at full size

When someone sends an image in a message, Zulip generates a small preview if
the image is a common image type, like PNG, JPEG, or GIF.

To **view the image at full size**, click on the preview. From there, you
can **pan and zoom**, **download** the image, and **navigate to other
images** in the narrow. You can close the full screen view by clicking
anywhere outside the image.

!!! tip ""
    Use `v` to **open** the full screen view. From there you
    can use the arrow keys to navigate to other images in the narrow.
    Use `v` or `Esc` to **close**.
