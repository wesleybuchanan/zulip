{!create-bot-construct-url.md!}

If you'd like to hardcode the `topic` used by the bot, simply append
`&topic=topic_name` to the end of the above URL, where `topic_name`
is your topic.

Go to the account settings page of your HelloSign account and
under the **Integrations** tab, go to **API** and **Account Callback**.
Add the above URL with your modifications under the section
**Account Callback**.
