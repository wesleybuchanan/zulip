*If you are running JIRA version 5.2 or greater, or if you are
using the hosted JIRA provided by Atlassian, you can use the built-in

self-hosted JIRA installs, you can use our [JIRA Plugin](./jira-plugin).*

Next, in your JIRA administration control panel, go to the **Webhooks**
page. If you are using the OnDemand hosted JIRA, follow the instructions
[on the Atlassian wiki][1] for locating the Webhook UI.

Give your new webhook a name, and for the URL provide the URL we
created above.
